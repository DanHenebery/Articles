#The District Beer Trail

The District Beer trail is inspired by the work of Randy Olson who has created [epic road trips](http://www.randalolson.com/2015/03/10/computing-the-optimal-road-trip-across-europe/) and [left Waldo with nowhere to hide](http://www.randalolson.com/2015/02/03/heres-waldo-computing-the-optimal-search-strategy-for-finding-waldo/) using genetic algorithms. Brewery locations were compiled by Kate Rabinowitz of DataLensDC, who has compiled a dataset of over [70 regional breweries](http://www.datalensdc.com/DC-region-breweries.html).
