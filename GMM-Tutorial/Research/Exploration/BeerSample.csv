"1","tmEthz","""Admiral"" Stache","Milwaukee Brewing Co’s take on a classic European style. Baltic Porters are the stronger lager fermented cousin of the classic London Porter. The higher strength and cold fermentation help to create a smooth, less fruity porter, rich in roasted malt flavors and aromas. The “Admiral” Stache has a deep brown hue with a light caramel head. Toffee and milk chocolate dominate the flavor with subtle hints of dried fruit. One month of aging in Bourbon Barrels imparted a layer of vanilla and oak.

We first developed this beer in 2007. Our first attempted batch of beer at the 2nd street location was a Baltic Porter. What we ended up with became known as “Shake Down Nut Brown”. You can guess what went wrong from there… But, so many things right! Every year that has gone by, the beer has gotten a little bit stronger, in flavor and alcohol.

We use a black malt for the dark rich color and an extra special malt for the dried fruit flavors. Baltic Porters are fermented cold with a lager yeast. That long slow maturation creates a smooth flavor profile. The anticipation of the bourbon barrel aging it the most exciting part of this brew process. We want that oak character with hints of bourbon, we use 3rd run barrels for this result. Each batch has been slightly different from the last.","Seasonal",7,23,"BU4IJP","Milwaukee Brewing Company",104,"Baltic Porter",9,"Other Lager",37,"#3F0708"

"6","SO0wLA","11th Anniversary Ale","To acknowledge this year’s anniversary, our 11th, Allagash’s brewers decided to use a champagne yeast for both the primary and secondary fermentations. This beer was brewed with both Cascade and Northern Brewer hops and copious amounts of Belgian Aromatic Malt to achieve its vibrant garnet color and unique, malty palate. At a hefty 9% ABV, the alcohol in this brew is balanced by a light sweetness, a full-bodied mouth feel and a gentle, lingering hop character. 

Just prior to bottling, when there is no carbonation present in the beer, a fresh dose of sugar and yeast is added. After bottling, the beer is aged in our temperature-controlled cellar, where the yeast ferments the sugar and naturally carbonates the beer. This process, known as méthode champenoise, is the same traditional process we use for all of our bottled beers. 

The batch of 11th Anniversary Ale was bottled in May of '06 - 950 cases, six bottles in each case and is the only batch that will be available. Its aroma is redolent of red licorice, nutmeg, wild apple, and hard candy. Its taste is malty with date and fig notes with a finish that is crisp, striking a balance between dry and fruity.

The craft brewing movement has long been called a ""revolution."" But today the air is so thick with revolution, it's palpable. No longer is it only an awareness among the faithful; the unconverted are beginning to feel it as well. Denial and ignorance are disappearing in favor of opened eyes, curiosity and the sense that there's something larger out there. For far too long we have been lied to. For far too long we have been oppressed by the notion that dumbed-down lowest-common-denominator mediocrity was all that we could, and should, expect. You might think we're talking only about the world of brewing, but we're not. There is a myriad of products out there masquerading as cheeses, coffee, chocolates, breads...hell, there is stuff pretending to be ""food"" that our great-grandmothers would not recognize as such. Yet the craft brewing movement, together with the artisanal food movement, is making much progress. Where the industrial companies can't dismiss or bury us, they are attempting to copy us with cheap facsimiles. Yes, chances are if you are holding this bottle, you understand these things to be true about the world of brewing. You also likely understand the importance of our fight at Stone against accepted ""norms"" over the last 15 years. We believed that America was ready to embrace things made with artistry and passion. You have spoken. Your response has been clear. We are not merely consumers to be spoon-fed whatever commodities need to be unloaded for a profit. We have only just begun to move the needle of this revolution, and mediocrity still reigns. Consider that when you reject dumbed down, industrialized food and drink, you also support craft brewing. The line is nearly seamless; we are fighting the same battle. We will not win in our lifetime, as the powers are too entrenched, and the masses too fooled. And shackled. However, this is a revolution of ideas and of taste, and we will win. How do you want to be viewed by your children, and your children's children? As a hero, or as the oppressed? (Those that don't think they have been oppressed are already lost.) Ultimately, it's up to you to decide. We hope you'll stand with us. Strong and unyielding. You are needed. This bottle and its glorious contents are a celebration of you, brothers and sisters, and your importance in this fight.

In fact, it is this high alcohol content coupled with extensive aging which contributes to the very complex nature of our Blunderbuss. A beverage such as this is meant to be savored and appreciated much like a fine brandy or cognac, or, in the world of wine, a fortified sherry or vintage port. (But a barleywine is all beer!)
The process of creating our barleywine began by cramming our mash tun to overflowing with American and Scottish pale malts. We then extracted only the richest first runnings from the mash and boiled extensively to further concentrate the sugars in the wort. During the boil a touch of honey was added to the kettle, along with six varieties of hops to provide balance for the sweet malt. Fermented in stainless it was then sent to the CBC Barrel Cellar where it aged in a quintet of Buffalo Trace rye barrels (previously used for aging a strong beer named Utopias, brewed by our neighbors in J.P.).
The result is well worth this painstaking ordeal. A creamy, pale tan head rests atop this beautiful, hazy golden liquid. Captured within the rim of a snifter, the first aromas to greet the nose are of alcohol’s fruity esters, then rich caramel, and sweet malt. As it warms, more distinguishable notes of burnt sugar and toffee, vanilla, coconut and oak are detectable. The flavor more than meets the prelude of aromas. Its rich, full body contains notes of sweet caramel, tart flavors of berries and dried fruit, and a subtle herbal hoppiness. This is finished by warming alcohol and a lingering finish with hints of vanilla, coconut, toasted marshmallow and oak. This ultimate after-dinner drink pairs well with many desserts, but is also certainly a dessert in and of itself.

Big'er, Bad'er and Bold'er, the 29'er is the bike (and beer) to go huge on. With 29"" wheels instead of the usual 26"", this monster bike eats the trail up in chunks. We thought it a suitable name for this slightly more aggressive India Brown Ale. 29'er is a classic brown with a hoppy roasted nose to balance a nutty, strong malt body that finishes with smooth chocolate and coffee undertones. Goes well with the adrenaline rush of bombing down a backcountry trail. Enjoy the ride, friends. Bombs Away!

Brewers Gabe Fletcher of Midnight Sun Brewing Company [Anchorage, AK] and Colby Chandler of Ballast Point Brewing Company [San Diego, CA] designed and brewed an exciting representation of their passions: hops, Belgian yeast, oak aging and Brettanomyces.

Just prior to the Great Alaska Beer & Barley Wine Fest in JAN 2009, Gabe and Colby brewed a West Coast-worthy IPA at Midnight Sun Brewing Company.

We fermented 5 O’Clock Shadow at cold temperatures with a select German lager yeast and cold-conditioned it for over four months to create a velvety smooth wintertime warmer.

"23","Edu7My","6288 Stout","Introduced in 2007, the 6288 Stout is our winter season specialty beer. It is a rather lengthy process to brew the 6288 Stout. It is brewed with 5 different malted barleys, using American and French hops. Keeping with the Tuckerman tradition, it is cold-conditioned, dry-hopped and bottle conditioned using the krausening process. The fermentation takes about two weeks, twice the time of our other beers and conditioning takes three months! It’s worth the wait, as the extra time gives this special brew time to mellow, offering a very smooth dark, malty flavor.

The 6288 Stout is named for the elevation of New England’s tallest peak, Mount Washington. Tuckerman Brewing Co. is a supporter of the Mount Washington Observatory and donates a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Stout to the Observatory’s weather and science exploration.

"29","oGO96g","A-Town Brown","Red Brick Brown Ale is the beer that launched our brewing legacy in 1993. It was inspired by the malty brews of England, but we gave it an American sized attitude. Deep copper gives way to an off-white head when poured into a glass, offering aromas of sweet malt, caramel, and almond. Our Brown Ale is surprisingly light bodied, which plays well with the sweet caramel, fresh pecan, and bread notes you discover on each sip. Brown Ale is a great beer to enjoy outdoors on a clear autumn afternoon.","Seasonal",6.5,16,"11gqIZ","Red Brick Brewing Company",37,"American Brown",3,"North American Origin Ales",18,"#A63E00"

The story of this beer dates back to January 2006 when for the first time came into contact with the character so new and irresistible American hops. However I realized right away that in Pale Ale of my dreams I wanted to express something that goes far beyond this, since the construction of a complex bouquet, charming and never usual was my challenge. For this Travelling between England and Germany, visiting hop growers and experiencing very distant varieties (New Zealand) I conducted a search in the olfactory area of hops that perhaps will never be totally finished (without prejudice to the unmistakable character of A.F.O. that will always remain this). A beer that I always coveted: dedicated to the obsessed of Ales like me.","Year Round",5.4,NA,"354Wth","Birrificio del Ducato",25,"American Pale",3,"North American Origin Ales",NA,NA

Instead, according to The Beer Connoisseur, ONLINE, India Pale Ale seems to have developed out of the idea current at least as far back as the 1760s that it was “absolutely necessary” to add extra hops to beer intended to be drunk in hot climates. The Bow Brewery became the dominant shipper of the lighter style beer to India, mostly because of its close proximity to the East India Company docks on the River Thames. Lady Luck strikes again. 

The Addlehead IPA formula calls for a blending of 5 grains and 3 hops to produce a beer that IPA devotees appreciate but others also find pleasantly tasty. 

Addlehead has a golden yellow color and a full, rich body with a creamy head and a medium lace. It is rated at 95 IBU (International Bitterness Units), but it has a balanced hint of sweetness which is rare in an IPA.

East Green is a pale blonde beer that began life as an effort to produce an environmentally responsible beer that had flavour and integrity in equal balance. We wanted to design a beer that uses a minimum amount of energy without compromising on quality.

We use Pale Ale malted barley grown and malted in East Anglia, and Boadicea hops, which are grown in Suffolk’s only commercial hop yard. We chose Boadicea as not only is it available locally but it is also an aphid resistant hop. Aphids, as anyone who has a hop plant growing in their garden will know, love hops, and so aphicides are sprayed during the season. Boadicea is naturally resistant to aphids so this cuts down on the amount of pesticides that have to be used.

All that aside, we also think it is a great hop. It has a fantastic grassy lemon quality that works so well with this beer.

We also incorporated both flaked oats and oat malt in the mash to impart a rich silky mouthfeel and texture. Alderaan has complex malt flavors and aromas reminiscent of dark baker’s chocolate, fresh brewed coffee, and caramel candy.  Hop additions impart a clean, balanced bitterness and hints of earthy-spiciness dancing around the intense malt backbone. Don’t be fooled by the smooth easy drinking nature of this robust dark ale, it packs quite a punch! This is a very limited offering; the rest of the batch went into bourbon barrels earlier this year and will emerge this fall.

Since that time, A.B., his son (Warner Marion), grandson (William Craig), great grandson (Edward Kent), and/or great-great grandson ( Michael) have continuously practiced law in the State of Texas. 

 Named after Alfred Brown Peticolas, our English brown ale is a dialed back version of the American interpretation.

This beer’s body is medium-light and possesses a smooth texture with a hint of residual sweetness. 

 The roasted characteristics of this beer make it the perfect match for any meats or vegetables prepared on the grill.

 A little more on A.B. Peticolas? He was born in Richmond, Virginia, on May 27, 1838. As a young man, he studied law and taught school. He began his practice in Virginia, but ultimately moved west to Victoria, Texas. In 1859, he opened up a law practice with Samuel A. White. A.B. Peticolas may be best remembered today for his published Civil War journals and detailed pencil sketches, having served during the Sibley Campaign in New Mexico with Co. C., 4th Regiment, Texas Mounted Volunteers. After his discharge in 1865, he returned to Victoria to practice law. In 1894, A.B. Peticolas authored an index-digest to all civil cases contained in the Texas Report. This catalog became standard text of the Texas Bar Association for years. In his later years, A.B.

Full bodied with a malty richness and deep copper color derived from Victory malt and carries a delicate hop aroma. Before lager beer was made (1830's) in Germany, the style was Obergoriger Lageredbier, which means "" top-fermented lagered beer"". When Western Europe embraced the lager yeast in the middle of the 19th century, Dusseldorf decided to keep brewing their top-fermented beer. Altbier is thus an ale that is aged (lagered) like a lager. Altbier offers a smooth, rounded alternative to sharp, bitter Pilsners.

The beer finishes with a bright carbonation and a crisp dryness.

The Saison style originated in the France/Belgian border region of Wallonia. Saison is not a single style, but more a family of beers. They were originally made in small farmhouse breweries and could vary greatly in color & flavor from farm to farm. The word “saison” means “season” in French and Saison beers were usually brewed seasonally and used as payment & fortification for seasonal farm laborers known as “saisonnaires”. Many of the original Saison beers were produced in conditions that allowed wild yeasts to colonize them and impart flavors. These Brettanomyces yeasts are now being used by modern brewers to help replicate some of the flavors of the past. We age our Amber Saison in oak barrels with added Brettanomyces for a special fall release in our Barrel Roll Series that we call Falling Leaf.","Not Available",6.6,19,"peXEgv","Hangar 24 Craft Brewery",72,"Saison",5,"Belgian And French Origin Ales",NA,NA

This time we were looking to make the un-lawnmower beer (with an emphisis on the “UN”). Just how do we go about doing that? How about by starting with some of the world’s greatest pilsner malt from Weyermann in Bamberg, Germany? There’s no rice and corn in our darling either – just the best malted barley for purpose in the world. What else? All of the hops used in brewing American Darling come from the Hallertau hop region of Germany. Fermentation uses a blend of three of Europe’s great lager yeasts, low temperature fermentation and lagering, over a period of six weeks. Yes, that’s the UN lawnmower beer.

The next step in the process is to filter so that it can be more portable, without sediment to worry about disturbing. Put it in your coolers, your picnic baskets… your saddlebags. Take it to family reunions and pie eating contests, parades, beaches, fancy mustache conventions, hot dog factory tours, monorail excursions, secret basement lairs… wherever good summer fun happens!

Anchor Bock® Beer is brewed from a complex blend of malts, and fresh, whole-cone hops. In the ancient bock tradition, the dark-colored brew is released in time for springtime celebrations. Bock beers are believed to have originated in the town of Einbeck, Germany and traditionally feature a goat on their labels. The term, “bock” occurs in several Germanic languages and roughly translates to “billy goat”, but there are some unlikely alternatives. Followers of the zodiac have described it as a beer for Capricorn, the time when, as the days grow longer, brewers brew their bock beers in anticipation of the coming of spring.

"64","V6OyQ8","Anchor IPA","The California Gold Rush lured thousands west to ""see the elephant,"" a 19th-century metaphor for the hopeful but risky pursuit of happiness, adventure, and fortune. As early as 1849, India Pale Ale - prepared by British brewers for export to India by adding dry hops to barrels of hoppy ale - was also heading west, from England around the Horn to San Francisco. Thirsty ‘49ers savored the best imported IPAs, but it wasn’t until 1975 that Anchor, Americas' original craft brewery, pioneered the revival of dry-hopped handmade ales. Now, that tradition fast-forwards to an adventurous new brew: Anchor IPA™.

Anchor IPA™ is made with 2-row barley malt and fresh whole-cone hops, its bright amber color, distinctively complex aroma, spiky bitterness, malty depth, and clean finish unite to create a uniquely flavorful, memorable, and timeless craft IPA.

The elephant you see on Anchor IPA™ was hand-drawn by our label artist, James Stitt. To ""see the elephant"" was a popular 19th-century expression that originated with a tale that predates the California Gold Rush.

There once lived a farmer who had heard of elephants but had never seen one. He longed for the day when he might catch a glimpse of this rare, exotic creature. When the circus came to town, he loaded his wagon with fresh produce and headed to market. On the way, just as he'd hoped, he came across the circus parade, nobly led by an enormous elephant. The farmer was ecstatic, but his horses were terrified. They reared and bucked, overturning his wagon and scattering its precious contents in the road. ""I don’t give a hoot,"" exclaimed the farmer. ""I have seen the elephant!""

The elephant became the universal symbol of the Gold Rush, as evidenced by the journals, letters, and sketchbooks of the forty-niners. Whether or not they struck it rich in the diggings, those plucky pioneers would forever treasure their California adventure as the defining moment of their lives.

"64","7cX5PZ","Anchor Saison","Saisons originated with the rustic farmhouse ales of Wallonia, a mostly French-speaking region of Belgium. Bière de saison was brewed during the saison froide (cold season) for consumption during the warmer months. Today saisons are made and enjoyed year-round. As brewers, we were drawn to this beer style’s enigmatic history, the freedom it offers, and the creativity it demands.

Anchor Saison™ Spring Ale is a traditional Belgian-style saison with a California twist. The distinctiveness of roasted Belgian wheat malt is enhanced by the peppery, clove-like flavors of a locally cultured saison-style yeast. And, for this release, we chose three California ingredients—lemongrass, lemon peel, and ginger—whose synergy adds a tangy crispness and herbal spiciness to this sharply refreshing, uniquely Californian saison.

The completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 and the Southern Pacific’s “Sunset Route” in 1883, coupled with the advent of refrigerated railcars, made it possible for California brewers and farmers to ship their products out of state. Local artists and lithographers were engaged to create imaginative labels for bottles of beer and crates of fruit. Many of the latter featured colorful vignettes of California scenery framed by mouthwatering images of fresh citrus.

Inspired by those early fruit-crate labels and the ingredients in this release of Anchor Saison™ Spring Ale, our label features an original hand-colored 1873 lithograph of the Golden Gate as seen from Telegraph Hill. Our saison’s California ingredients—hand-drawn by our label artist Jim Stitt—adorn it, creating a uniquely Anchor label for a uniquely Anchor brew.","Spring",7.2,NA,"6PBXvz","Anchor Brewing Company",72,"Saison",5,"Belgian And French Origin Ales",NA,NA

We sprinkle warm water over the Old Foghorn mash after the first “wort” has run off, creating a second, lighter brew. Technically, both beers are ""ales"" because they are made with top-fermenting yeast. Like its forebears, the result is an easy-drinking “session” beer.

Anchor Steam® Beer derives its unusual name from the 19th century when “steam” was a nickname for beer brewed on the West Coast of America under primitive conditions and without ice. While the origin of the name remains shrouded in mystery, it likely relates to the original practice of fermenting the beer on San Francisco’s rooftops in a cool climate. In lieu of ice, the foggy night air naturally cooled the fermenting beer, creating steam off the warm open pans. Once a nickname for any West Coast beer brewed under these conditions, today the name “steam” is a trademark of Anchor Brewing and applies only to the singular process and taste of our flagship brand - San Francisco’s original Anchor Steam® Beer.

Ancient Aleiens has a deep dark cocoa taste up front that warms into a sweet coffee expression, finishing with a fruity hop aroma. Smooth toasted malt flavor balances the rich cocoa bitterness. It has the brown hue of iced coffee with a tan head. The coffee sweetens the beer in the middle, lending to nutty, caramel, and chocolate coffee flavors.

Ancient Soul Lifetime #1 is the first of our reincarnation series…it can be likened to the stages of metamorphosis that we see in nature, such as egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, butterfly.  In the stages of soul evolvement there is a search for balance and completion.  But is the soul ever really complete?

Each ingredient balances this creation, the wildflower honey takes from the oak barrel to complete the cycle.  Our aging for 6+ months in oak barrels, is done to guide the wildflower honey  to merge with the barrels smooth hints of oak  and have the floral notes to blossom once again.   It will not stop there.  We have not overthrown the lessons of the stages of the transformation in flavor.  We pull from this experience to help create the reincarnation of more flavors to come in the future.

It is a long journey but that’s okay because the soul is eternal.

This is just the B. ginning.

We return from whence we came, and present you a traditional Wildflower mead aged in oak barrels.  Take the journey with us September 24th from 2pm-12am.

"68","SlLcNo","Anniversary Ale 9","For this year's birthday beer we've teamed up with renowned street artist, Mike Watt, to create a collaboration brew with a difference.

""Besides great beer, our other true pleasure in life is visual art,"" says Murray. ""Every beer we brew has its own distinct personality and design. And now, we're introducing art to our anniversary, creating a limited edition bottle design in collaboration with guru, Mike Watt.""

Mike Watt is an Australian artist and illustrator based in Sydney. His mediums vary from biro, spray paint, brush and ink to digital. He describes his style as ""kind of gritty and ugly"", normally showing characters with lots of personality that have lived an interesting life.
""It's always great collaborating with Murray's. They're really into their craft and they make amazing beer. I love working with anyone who is passionate about what they do - when it's making amazing beer it makes it even better!"" said Mike Watt.

Murray's Anniversary Ale is always oak aged, always big and always a very limited release of around 1000 bottles. While this year's special brew gives a nod to its roots, reflecting the original recipe brewed to launch the company on New Year's Eve nine years ago, the recipe twist is aging the beer on Hunter Valley red wine barrel staves.

""These staves will not only add flavour and aroma from the inside surfaces that have been in contact with the red wine, but will also add raw oakiness from the outside surfaces of the staves,"" said Head Brewer, Graeme Mahy. ""The end result of the staves provides a unique combination of part oaky, part red wine flavours.""

An English-style barley wine, this year's Anniversary Ale features warming rich fruit cake-like sweetness from the caramel and roasted malts, with strong aromas of stone fruit and an assertive but balanced bitterness in the finish.

This big beer can be enjoyed now, however, we advise patience will be rewarded. Cellaring for 5-10 years (if you can) is recommended to maximise enjoyment from the maturing flavours.

""If you just can't hold out for 10 years, then try some over Christmas with a Christmas fruit pudding. Or in the New Year, with some ultra-rich and strong blue cheese,"" adds Graeme.","Limited",10,NA,"I0AWx9","Murray's Craft Brewing Co",17,"British Barleywine",1,"British Origin Ales",NA,NA

Beginning in 2010, ADBW will be released in late SEP.

In its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table.

Each annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time. We invite you to savor Arctic Devil Barley Wine upon its release then cellar some for future enjoyment.

"77","Cf2Bi3","Aries","Aries is the 3rd installment in the latest round of Brewers’ Select Series beers!  Aries breaks the mold of preceding Brewers’ Select beers in that it is NOT a new beer—rather, it is a blend of two existing beers which have been being mixed by Weyerbacher employees for a few years now.  In perfect timing for October / Halloween, Aries is a delicious blend of Old Heathen Imperial Stout and Imperial Pumpkin Ale!

Known around the brewery as a “Black & Orange”, this mix is generally credited to Weyerbacher’s Philly Sales Rep Mike Lubieski as being a way to support his Flyers and also by NJ Sales Rep Natalie DeChico who got it into firkins here and there (she’s the former Philly Beer Geek and creator of Althea).  By mixing these two brews, the otherwise pretty dominant cinnamon and nutmeg spices of Imperial Pumpkin Ale are subdued by Old Heathen while highlighting the malt backbone of both beers. The result is a really balanced yet spicy dark beer which will work very well as a dessert beer and still pair nicely with your favorite fall foods.

Since both Old Heathen and Imperial Pumpkin Ale are each 8% ABV, Aries is also a very manageable 8% [really complicated math here].

When Aries was originally conceived, the plan was to mix Heresy—our Bourbon barrel-aged Old Heathen—with Imperial Pumpkin Ale.  On the day the decision had to be made, however, it was found that the brand new batch of Old Heathen actually tasted better in the mix so we switched things up a bit.

"84","fe44im","Augustijn Ale","Appearance. Augustijn Ale has a foamy white head that lingers in a very thin layer on top of the beer until the last drop. It has a honey orange color and is cloudy like a gem stone but you can still through the beer enough to see the bubbles.

Smell. It has the expected Belgian yeast aroma, but with a slight twist like a fresh banana that is ever so slightly green and a hint of cloves. Unexpectedly, however, this beer has a subtle but nice citrus-orange hoppy bouquet. For me, the bouquet did not last until the end, maybe the smell of food overpowered it.  There is also the aroma of sweet barley malt.

Taste. Augustijn Ale has a barley malt sweetness that is wel balanced by the hop bitterness. The malt flavor is much stronger tasting than is was smelling. The sweetness of the malt is enhanced by the fresh slightly-unripe banana. The clove is more prominent in the flavor probably by the slightly spicy hop flavors. This beer went very well with the baked brie “en brioche” appetizer at the restaurant.

Mouthfeel. Despite being 8% alcohol by volume, this is a medium-bodied beer. From the original gravity of 1.076 and the alcohol content, I calculated the final gravity to be 1.015. Although it is clearly medium-bodied, Augustijn Ale at times seems lighter bodied. This might be due to the high alcohol content and the effervescence. The level of carbonation is pleasant and a touch higher than most North American craft beers that I have drinking lately.

Drinkability. Except for Belgian witbier, I usually only want a single Belgian beer per session. The flavors are so intense that one is usually enough. Augustijn Ale, so far, is the exception. I think I enjoyed the particular balance of flavors that this beer imparts. It coudl also be the strain of yeast (which I might try harvesting for some homebrew). I found myself craving another glass immediately upon finishing the first glass. I find this to be a much more drinkable Belgian without losing any of the Belgian beer qualities.","Year Round",8,NA,"shhuGO","Brouwerij Van Steenberge",59,"Belgian Tripel",5,"Belgian And French Origin Ales",NA,NA

"85","T71yJt","Automatic","We are bringing back our seasonal American Pale Ale, Automatic!  Automatic is a modern pale ale with an ABV of 5.2-­-percent that features a prominent hop flavor and aroma. The beer appears hazy and straw colored with densely packed and persistent white foam. A mix of Mosaic and Crystal hops are used to create a delicate balance and give the beer an aroma that features a complex array of berry, citrus, herbal and pine notes.

“Automatic is meant to be light, refreshing and quite drinkable without falling into the common pitfall of ending up too thin, watery or insipid. No color malts were used, however, the relatively full mouthfeel is enough to support this heavily hopped beer,” says Co-­Founder and Brewmaster Adam Beauchamp. “The flavor mirrors the aroma with a bit more earthiness and stone fruit, leading to a nicely balanced and moderately bitter finish.”

Once again, we collaborated with a local artist to design the can label. Athens’ painter, Michelle Fontaine was inspired by 1950s American popular culture as well as the origin of our facility – a former 1940s Chevy dealership and later the Snow Tire Company. The label she designed for Automatic has a classic automotive theme.

"86","wvqTEV","Autumn 2011 Farmhouse Pale","We’re proud to introduce our new “Farm to Bottle” Series of beers. Brewed to be enjoyed fresh, these bright and refreshing ales capture the essence of each season’s harvest.

Inspired by the fruit markets of San Francisco’s Mission District, our Autumn 2011 Farmhouse Pale is an homage to indian summer in Northern California. By selecting the last organic plums of the season and blending in rich piloncillo—an unrefined brown sugar popular in Mexican desserts—we brewed a beer that celebrates both the Bay Area fall harvest and one of San Francisco’s most vibrant neighborhoods.

Our first “Farm to Bottle” release is a Belgian-style farmhouse ale bursting with distinctive hop and yeast aromas. During the brew, we blended in the piloncillo and over one thousand pounds of ripe, organic California plums from the fertile orchards of Twin Girls Farm in the San Joaquin Valley. The plums add a subtle yet bright and fruity character to the beer. Next, we dosed the beer with generous helpings of Cascade and Amarillo hops. Added primarily at the end of the brewing process and then again after fermentation (dry hopping), these hop varietals give our beer it’s characteristic tangerine and grapefruit aromas.","Limited",7,29,"0dM1NH","Almanac Beer Co",62,"Belgian Pale",5,"Belgian And French Origin Ales",NA,NA

These characteristics are intensified by homemade dark candy sugar.

After three months of aging these two were remarried resulting in a beer that is complex but not complicated, thick and rich but not cloying.

The Baby Tree is a real tree. This must be said. It dwells in Sexhow and carries cavorting baby-dolls and in season, a few pears appear. It belongs to great friends of Dann & Martha, and they chose to rescue these small plastic people from a landfill-fate by allowing them to ride in their pear-tree many years ago. And thank heavens they did.

Our Baby Tree is a very magical, traveling tree filled with waving, happy babies, some of whom may or may not resemble Mikheil Gorbachev. There may also be some discrepancy in the number of limbs, but we cannot be sure where other baby heads may be poking through the leaves so we don’t worry ourselves about it. If you want, read our poem about it.

Baby Tree beer is a Pretty Things take on the best of Abbey-style brewing from Belgium. Inspired by monastic and abbey quadruples, embellished with dark fruit flavours, not too sweet, not too heavy, it’s a springtime beer with some of the richness of late winter. It makes it perfect year round, so that’s when we offer it! You should be able to find it most months of the year, on draft or in bottle.

The year of 2004 witnessed a ""new birth"" of the Baltika #3: the glass bottle received a new shape and label, which was accompanied by the first canning of the brand. In May 2006 the Baltika #3 was produced in an innovative package: a premium 1 liter PET-package that looks practically the same as the half-liter glass bottle. In 2007 the Baltika #3 bottle received an embossed lettering. At the same time the brand was produced in a one-liter aluminum can that was new for the market. In April 2008 a 1.5-liter PET bottle with a ""football"" design was produced for the Baltika #3, especially for the Russian Football Championship. The PET-glass material has high protective qualities and keeps the most popular Russian beer fresh for a longer period.

Due to the high demand the production of this popular brand keeps growing. By the results of the 2008, the volume of sales amounted +7,5% (Business Analytica) , which allows the brand to remain a certain leader in the medium-price segment. The highest distribution level of Baltika Company for food products (98%) makes the Baltika <U+2116>3 available for buyers all over the country.

Today the Classic beer is exported to over 40 countries around the world, including Germany, Japan, Great Britain, the United Arab Emirates, Greece, France, and Ireland.

For ten years running the Baltika #3 Classic has received the prestigious Russian ""Commodity of the Year"" prize in the field of consumer goods. The prize is awarded to the most popular mass consumption products available in the assortment of retail shops. Since the time the prize was established the Baltika #3 Classic has been the unconditional leader in the ""beer"" category.

This beer brand is also annually declared ""The Most People’s Brand"" by the results of tasting at the Moscow Beer Festival, the largest beer festival in Russia. In 2008 the Baltika #3 won a silver medal at the Superior Taste Award contest in Brussels established by the International Taste and Quality Institute.

"99","0AU9pA","Banryu Ichi","here is an old saying in Japan, “There are ten thousand ways to make sake.”
CBC is very proud to introduce number ten thousand and one.
Banryu Ichi (10,001 ways in Japanese) is an experimental brew that straddles the line between beer and sake. Produced in collaboration with our good friend and masterful sake home-brewer, Todd Bellomy, this has been one of the most interesting and labor-intensive beers ever to come out of CBC.
We began last December by spending many cold, windy days in the alley behind the brewery, steaming rice in small batches to brew what became almost fifty gallons of pure sake. Sake is produced by multiple parallel fermentation: polished rice is converted to sugar by a fungus called Koji (Aspergillus oryzae) and fermentation is taken care of by sake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae kyokai). After several weeks of fermentation this batch of sake (possibly the largest batch of sake ever made in New England) was destined to become the starter for our beer.
Just after Christmas, Todd joined us again to brew a mere six barrels of the craziest beer wort ever. Pale barley malt and flaked rice went into the mash, and after extracting only the first runnings we added a significant amount of brown rice syrup. This yielded a wort of 31*P/1.124SG, or in other words, some really thick, sticky stuff! The wort was sent to the fermenter and then, with fingers crossed, we pumped over the entire batch of sake including the yeast, Koji, and lots of rice slurry. Fermentation was slow and low at 50*F for six weeks, followed by cold-conditioning until it reached more than 15%abv!
Incredibly complex aromas and flavors abound, including sweet rice, fresh apples and grapes, hints of earth and mushroom from the koji, and as it warms further notes of fennel, herbs, and an almost Belgian-yeast spiciness. Brilliant copper-colored, it is full in body despite its very dry finish. This is one to be sipped, savored, and contemplated. Banryu Ichi is a truly unique beverage, served with intentionally very low carbonation in a 5oz. glass set inside a Masu, a traditional cedar sake cup.

Bardstown is the very first beer OHB has ever bottled.  It was made in very limited quantities, only about 150 cases were made.

About the name: Bardstown is the county seat for Nelson County, Kentucky and is the host city of the annual Bourbon Festival.  Most of the famous bourbons made hail from this area of Kentucky. A few years ago Steven was visiting Bardstown and the many distillers around Kentucky.While visiting the distilleries, Steven arranged to pick up some freshly used barrels, empty less than a day.  The barrels were brought back to the brewery and filled right away. The barrels rested in the brewery for a year, full of barley wine. 

When the beer was just right, the barrels were emptied into a tank and allowed to condition before being bottled, one at a time, by hand. 

As Bardstown is such a big and robust beer, as well as being 10%, it will age very well, becoming more mellow as the years pass.

"102","P0kNsL","Barley's Blood Thirst Wheat","About the Ale: It's difficult to find out just when oranges were introduced into what is now Italy. From their travels to the southern and eastern reaches of their Empire, the Romans knew of them, and oranges are occasionally depicted in Roman art.

However, it is generally accepted that citrus fruits were first cultivated in Sicily during the Arab period, in the ninth and tenth centuries.

The modern English word orange, like the Italian arancia, probably derives from the Arabic naranj. Oranges are native to tropical Asia, particularly the Malay region.

Cultivation of oranges gradually spread through China and India to east Africa and then to the Mediterranean region. The trees enjoy a mild climate, sunny weather and good drainage. An occasional frost or chill does not harm them.

Blood oranges are so called for their red flesh and deep red juice. When ripe, their skin may also be reddish, at least in part. In the British Empire, blood oranges were called ""Maltese"" oranges, and are closely related to Jaffa oranges. In Sicily, the most popular blood oranges are the Tarocco, the Moro and the Sanguigno, the latter cultivated extensively in the western part of the island as the Sanguinello of Paternò and Adernò. Though consumed in salads and desserts, blood oranges are favored for their distinctive red juice which, as it happens, is exceptionally healthy, being rich in antioxidants.

The blood orange is considered particularly Sicilian, perhaps because it is not as widely cultivated in Calabria, Spain or Greece. It is worth mentioning that, as regards citrus fruits generally, Italy is one of the world's largest producers of lemons, most of which are harvested in Sicily. It was this citrus production that earned the hills and valleys around Palermo the name ""Conca d'Oro"" (golden seashell) in the Middle Ages.","Limited",5,2.9,"p85u1P","Barley's Smokehouse & Brewpub",112,"Wheat Ale",11,"Hybrid/mixed Beer",NA,NA

"102","93Tklc","Barley's Infinity Grand Cru","Barley's Infinity Grand Cru is a wonderfully complex Belgian dark strong ale.

Complex, with a rich malty sweetness, fruity esters and significant alcohol with moderate spiciness.

The malt is rich and forward, with caramel and toast aroma. The esters give raisin, plum and dried cherry notes, with a subtle pepperiness.

This is not a Belgian that's going to get all clove and banana on you. The Belgian yeast strain we used gives us the fruity esters we were looking for, as well as the higher alcohol.

So what's a Grand Cru?

Historically, Grand cru is a regional wine classification that designates a vineyard known for its favorable reputation. The term is not technically a classification of wine quality per se, but is intended to indicate the potential of the vineyard.

At one time, Belgium was a part of Burgundy. Elder Belgians will tell you that their love of great food and drink has its origins in the time when they were part of Burgundy.

Belgium of course has a great tradition of brewing fantastic ales. It's only natural that they would adopt this wine term to describe their best beers.

We decided to adopt this moniker for our Belgian dark strong ale. Barley's Infinity Grand Cru.

...to the kettle, it might just carmelize.

We were right, and lucky for us, the kettle didn't crack. The result is MacLenny's Scottish Ale. It's even a little famous...

On page 108 of Michael Jackson's Beer Companion, he writes, ""In 1994, I tasted the orangey, toffeeish Scottish Ale, made by an interesting process of carmelization,, at Barley's brewpub in Columbus, Ohio. The kettle was turned on while still empty, then the wort was added. This is a potentially dangerous procedure: don't try this at home.""

The brewing was later moved to the Sandlot Brewery at Coors Field. In February of 2012, Barmen production was moved back to AC Golden Brewing Company in order to make room for more Blue Moon innovations at the Sandlot Brewery.

Barmen was born of Pete Coors’ desire to brew a German Pilsner that tastes exactly like the great pilsners of northern Germany. The beer was named after Barmen, Germany; birthplace of Adolph Herman Joseph Coors. Barmen is offered in only a few bars and restaurants in and around Golden, CO.
 
To ensure you enjoy the full Barmen experience, bars and restaurants offering Barmen are requested to honor the traditional “German Seven-Minute Pour” and to serve the beer in the proper Barmen branded pilsner glass. When properly poured, it should look like this. Feel empowered to send the beer back to the bartender if it isn’t served correctly.

This Pilsner pours a golden straw color, with a beautiful cap of fluffy white foam that creates a “lace” on the sides of the glass as the beer is drank.

True to the style, Barmen begins with toasty bread and biscuity flavors before being rounded out by the spicy and floral hop flavors that only the Noble varieties can provide. Full bodied for a Pilsner, the brew finishes clean and crisp with just the perfect level of carbonation.

Our Winter releases for this year are a barrel-aged Trinity of beers that we have been maturing in oak barrels for most of the last year.

We believe that the beers that have been created by the time and the oak are incredibly tasty, complex, layered beers, perfect for enjoying with friends through the winter months. 

Ninkasi Premier Cru - came about after a visit to the Somerset Cider Brandy Company at Burrow Hill where Julian Temperley showed us  around his amazing farm. On smelling some of his used barrels we thought they would be the perfect vessel to age some of our Ninkasi in. The cider brandy flavours naturally combine beautifully with the apple flavours in the beer and the farmyard brettanomyces character in the beer has become more dominant. This is a beer we always wanted to make and we are delighted to say, it doesn't disappoint. Not as highly carbonated as the ""normal"" Ninkasi, this is softer, more mellow, with a long lingering fruit character. 

 

Raconteur - an aged barley wine, that has spent the last 9 months slowly developing in Marc de Bourgogne casks. We bought the barrels with this beer in mind, as soon as we opened them up the aroma that hit us screamed barley wine at us. It's a dark, warming style of bar, with a rich, boozy, fruitcake character. The big flavours and warming alcohol make this the perfect winter beer. 

 

Whiskebeest - a year ago we put 2 barrels worth of Wildebeest in Whisky barrels - it was all we could spare. The rich chocolate, vanilla and coffee flavours have melded beautifully with the Whisky and the wood to produce a smooth and mellow beer.

After about a year in barrel, I was liking it, but it felt like it really needed something extra.  Enter the spices.  I'll admit, it seems like a really odd blend of spices.  Some of them were things we had sitting around, and some were additional ideas to supplement that blend.  My original concept was to release this in time for the holidays, but as the spices developed in the beer over the next year it didn't feel quite appropriate at that time, so it came out in Spring.  I's incredibly complex, but it is without a doubt a sipper.
 
Here, in Brewer's Notes, I will also come clean as to three embarrassing pieces of this label that make this Literary Greats release somewhat of a collector's item.

"119","S0o5OV","Be Still","Be Still is our dark sour and presented barrel-still, without carbonation, for optimum mouthfeel and balance. Brewed with roasted barley and biscuit malts, the structure of the beer comes from acid produced by our house lactobacillus culture as well as acid from brettanomyces and pediococcus activity during the 10-month aging period in rye whiskey and fresh pinot noir barrels. Prior to bottling, the rye and wine portions are blended together and allowed to sit on cascara (sun-dried exterior fruit of the coffee bean) and cocoa nibs to add depth and complexity. The beer retains the fingerprint of our yeast culture and evolves in your glass, but is a wild departure from our lively bottle-fermented offerings. Be Still is a glimpse into an alternative beer universe that is just waiting to be explored. Due to the nature of this beer (yeast-free), it is recommended that you consume the beer fresh within 6 months of batch date on bottle to avoid oxidation flavors from shrouding your experience.",NA,9,NA,"2k4vYl","The Ale Apothecary",132,"BBL Aged",11,"Hybrid/mixed Beer",NA,NA
