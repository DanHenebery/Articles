Instead, according to The Beer Connoisseur, ONLINE, India Pale Ale seems to have developed out of the idea current at least as far back as the 1760s that it was “absolutely necessary” to add extra hops to beer intended to be drunk in hot climates. The Bow Brewery became the dominant shipper of the lighter style beer to India, mostly because of its close proximity to the East India Company docks on the River Thames. Lady Luck strikes again. 

The Addlehead IPA formula calls for a blending of 5 grains and 3 hops to produce a beer that IPA devotees appreciate but others also find pleasantly tasty. 

Addlehead has a golden yellow color and a full, rich body with a creamy head and a medium lace. It is rated at 95 IBU (International Bitterness Units), but it has a balanced hint of sweetness which is rare in an IPA.

Fergus our Head brewer explains: “America might have started out replicating beer styles from the rest of the world but they have moved far beyond that and now their beer styles are influencing the rest of the world. I think their take on the original English India Pale Ale is the most successful. It’s may be slightly odd to recreate a version of a style that was originally exported from these shores, but I love the smell of hops and an American IPA is a showcase for citrus hops.

"7","V6OyQ8","Anchor IPA","The California Gold Rush lured thousands west to ""see the elephant,"" a 19th-century metaphor for the hopeful but risky pursuit of happiness, adventure, and fortune. As early as 1849, India Pale Ale - prepared by British brewers for export to India by adding dry hops to barrels of hoppy ale - was also heading west, from England around the Horn to San Francisco. Thirsty ‘49ers savored the best imported IPAs, but it wasn’t until 1975 that Anchor, Americas' original craft brewery, pioneered the revival of dry-hopped handmade ales. Now, that tradition fast-forwards to an adventurous new brew: Anchor IPA™.

Anchor IPA™ is made with 2-row barley malt and fresh whole-cone hops, its bright amber color, distinctively complex aroma, spiky bitterness, malty depth, and clean finish unite to create a uniquely flavorful, memorable, and timeless craft IPA.

The elephant you see on Anchor IPA™ was hand-drawn by our label artist, James Stitt. To ""see the elephant"" was a popular 19th-century expression that originated with a tale that predates the California Gold Rush.

There once lived a farmer who had heard of elephants but had never seen one. He longed for the day when he might catch a glimpse of this rare, exotic creature. When the circus came to town, he loaded his wagon with fresh produce and headed to market. On the way, just as he'd hoped, he came across the circus parade, nobly led by an enormous elephant. The farmer was ecstatic, but his horses were terrified. They reared and bucked, overturning his wagon and scattering its precious contents in the road. ""I don’t give a hoot,"" exclaimed the farmer. ""I have seen the elephant!""

The elephant became the universal symbol of the Gold Rush, as evidenced by the journals, letters, and sketchbooks of the forty-niners. Whether or not they struck it rich in the diggings, those plucky pioneers would forever treasure their California adventure as the defining moment of their lives.

Appearance: Clear copper color with a white head.
Aroma: Floral citrusy hop aroma
Taste: Citrus and resinous pine balanced by toasted, bready malts. Good amount of bittering, but certainly not over the top; strong dry hop character.
Mouth feel: Medium body and good mouth feel that holds to the end

The beer appears hazy and straw colored with densely packed and persistent white foam. A mix of Mosaic and Crystal hops are used to create a delicate balance and give the beer an aroma that features a complex array of berry, citrus, herbal and pine notes.

“Automatic is meant to be light, refreshing and quite drinkable without falling into the common pitfall of ending up too thin, watery or insipid. No color malts were used, however, the relatively full mouthfeel is enough to support this heavily hopped beer,” says Co-­Founder and Brewmaster Adam Beauchamp. “The flavor mirrors the aroma with a bit more earthiness and stone fruit, leading to a nicely balanced and moderately bitter finish.”

Once again, we collaborated with a local artist to design the can label. Athens’ painter, Michelle Fontaine was inspired by 1950s American popular culture as well as the origin of our facility – a former 1940s Chevy dealership and later the Snow Tire Company. The label she designed for Automatic has a classic automotive theme.

For far too long we have been oppressed by the notion that dumbed-down lowest-common-denominator mediocrity was all that we could, and should, expect. You might think we're talking only about the world of brewing, but we're not. There is a myriad of products out there masquerading as cheeses, coffee, chocolates, breads...hell, there is stuff pretending to be ""food"" that our great-grandmothers would not recognize as such. Yet the craft brewing movement, together with the artisanal food movement, is making much progress. Where the industrial companies can't dismiss or bury us, they are attempting to copy us with cheap facsimiles. Yes, chances are if you are holding this bottle, you understand these things to be true about the world of brewing. You also likely understand the importance of our fight at Stone against accepted ""norms"" over the last 15 years. We believed that America was ready to embrace things made with artistry and passion. You have spoken. Your response has been clear. We are not merely consumers to be spoon-fed whatever commodities need to be unloaded for a profit. We have only just begun to move the needle of this revolution, and mediocrity still reigns. Consider that when you reject dumbed down, industrialized food and drink, you also support craft brewing. The line is nearly seamless; we are fighting the same battle. We will not win in our lifetime, as the powers are too entrenched, and the masses too fooled. And shackled. However, this is a revolution of ideas and of taste, and we will win. How do you want to be viewed by your children, and your children's children? As a hero, or as the oppressed? (Those that don't think they have been oppressed are already lost.) Ultimately, it's up to you to decide. We hope you'll stand with us. Strong and unyielding. You are needed. This bottle and its glorious contents are a celebration of you, brothers and sisters, and your importance in this fight. Cheers to all we've accomplished together in the past 15 years, and cheers to the adventure ahead!",NA,10.8,100,"709vEK","Stone Brewing",31,"Imperial IPA",3,"North American Origin Ales",41,"#000000"

"7","ocqOOM","Blue Dot Double India Pale Ale","Named after planet Earth, the only blue planet in this universe, and brewed in honor of Earth Day, with organic Pilsner malt, rye malt and a combo of intense hops. Pours a cloudy (unfiltered) golden, orangey, straw color, topped with a thin creamy white lace with minimal stick. Somewhat pungent in the nose with tons of herbal, floral, citrus grapefruit, raw honey and fresh mint. Fairly full-bodied, thick-ish, smooth, even and creamy. Then the hops come to play with a raw leafy coarseness and big smack of grapefruit, ripe pineapple, salt, rinds, hint of soapiness (not a bad thing), and some sticky resins on the palate. This is all backed by a malt sweetness, touch of honey, and a spicy character unique to the addition of rye. There's some spice and warmth from the alcohol too. Dry and biscuity toward the finish.
