longer to respond to neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River, and the river itself seems to be part of the cause. According to data obtained from DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services (FEMS) under the Freedom of Information Act, areas of the city where the proportion of all critical 911 calls where an ambulance took more than 10 minutes to arrive at the scene from the time they were notified, tend to be clustered south of the Anacostia.\\n\\n![FEMS_800](/content/images/2017/11/FEMS_800.png)\\n\\nWhen Dr. Julette Saussy, the former head of emergency medical services for DC, resigned last February, she wrote an [open letter](http://dcist.com/2016/02/_dr_jullette_saussy_resignation.php) to the city explaining her reasons. In the letter she mentions Robert Leroi Wiggins, a 35-year-old man stabbed in the Benning Ridge neighborhood on January 27, 2016.

Extrapolating from 83.6 million tons of coal raised from mines in the UK in 1861, he estimated that by 1961 UK coal consumption would stand at 2.6 billion tons per year. This is an incredible estimate, roughly equivalent to [actual coal production for the entire world in 1960](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:329110/FULLTEXT01.pdf). Given the population of the UK at the time, this estimate adjusts to 50 tons per person. Put in one place, this amount of coal would create a pile over 30 meters wide at its base. Actual 1961 per capita coal production in the UK [was 3.7 tons per person](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/historical-coal-data-coal-production-availability-and-consumption-1853-to-2011), a number very close to the same statistic in Jevons’ time.\\n\\n![PilesOfCoal](/content/images/2018/06/PilesOfCoal.png)\\n\\nActual coal consumption in the UK [peaked in the 1950s and has decreased ever since](http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/01/uk-coal-use-to-fall-to-lowest-level-since-industrial-revolution/). This is due to laws like the [Clean Air Act of 1956](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_1956), banning certain uses of coal, and the increased adoption of alternate energy sources, particularly nuclear power and natural gas from the North Sea. \\n \\nWhile peak coal came and went without triggering a [Malthusean Catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Malthusian_catastrophe), it is not clear that Jevons was wrong. Without legislative intervention and the discovery of new sources of energy to exploit, the growth in coal consumption may have continued unabated. Increased efficiency may or may not have had much, if anything, to with ultimately decreasing total demand for coal. Does this mean increased efficiency pointless then for ecological purposes?\\n\\nIt depends.\\n \\n### A Modern Test of Jevons’ Paradox\\n\\nConsider gasoline consumption in the United States. In the last 40 years the fuel efficiency of vehicles in the US and per capita consumption demonstrate a negative relationship. This has occurred without any significant legislation, mandating increases in fuel economy ([CAFE standards](http://www.nhtsa.gov/fuel-economy) remained fixed for most of this period) and without any viable alternatives to gasoline. In other words, trends in gasoline consumption seem to pair real increases in efficiency with real decreases in consumption.\\n\\n![GasPerCap_FuelEfficiency](/content/images/2018/06/GasPerCap_FuelEfficiency.png)\\n \\nPart of the reason for this negative relationship is the fact that price has a strong influence on both of these variables. When fuel is expensive drivers prefer more efficient cars and pocket the extra savings. When fuel is cheap, drivers’ preferences shift away from fuel economy. An extreme example of this is the H1, [an over-engineered military-grade vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Hummer_H1), sold to civilians during the mid-90s fuel price nadir.\\n \\nWhat Americans do not change based on the price of gas is how many miles they drive. In recent decades, consumers in the United States tend to drive a relatively consistent amount [regardless of the price of gas](http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=19191). Driving is something Americans do by necessity, and there are few incentives to drive any more or less than we already do.\\n\\nIf we stylize these facts, we can get a rough estimate of the degree to which increases in fuel efficiency are realized as fuel savings. Assuming Americans always drive a fixed number of miles in a given year and make predictable vehicle choices given the price of gas, analysis of the data estimates that a 10% increase in fuel efficiency results in about a 4% decrease in per-capita fuel consumption. It is worth noting that while these assumptions are simplistic, [more sophisticated analyses](http://www.rff.org/RFF/Documents/RFF-DP-13-19.pdf) concur that decreases in fuel consumption are always less than the corresponding increase in fuel efficiency.\\n \\nThat a 10% increase in fuel efficiency results in anything less than a 10% decrease in fuel consumption tells us that Jevons' paradox still holds to a degree: if gasoline or bituminous coal becomes more affordable, more of it will be consumed. Whether the magnitude of this demand rebound is greater than savings due to increased efficiency is a function of many factors such as preferences and the availability of close substitutes.\\n\\n### Increases in efficiency are not everything\\n\\nThe benefits of getting more out of less are self-evident, but they do not address fundamental problems. Resources like coal and gasoline have large, unrealized social costs and their rate of consumption is disproportionately skewed towards the present. These market failures persist regardless of how efficiently a resource can be used.\\n\\nWhat does help is legislation designed to correct specific market failures. These laws attempt to ensure that full social costs of any resource are explicitly allocated to those producing and consuming resources, rather than being borne by society as a whole. A basic form of this is the UK's Clean Air Act of 1956, which banned certain uses of coal. This law is credited with ending the recurrent [air pollution events in London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smog), and improving public health.\\n\\nA more sophisticated approach is [Cap and Trade](http://www.edf.org/climate/how-cap-and-trade-works). This scheme, efficiently allocates pollution \\\"credits\\\" via auction. Firms choose between purchasing credits for the right to create a certain amount of pollution or investing in cleaner technologies. Either way, the hidden costs of resource consumption are made explicit based on willingness to pay. This approach is popular with economists, less so with politicians.\\n\\nJevons’ Paradox in a nutshell: Efficiency is good, but alone it does less than you'd think.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<p><em>This piece was originally published on the blog, Questionable Economics.

It is\nincluded here as part of a selection of my favorite posts from that site.\n\nJevons’ Paradox [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox]  refers to the\neconomic circumstances that cause total demand for a resource to rise in spite\nof advances in the efficient use of that resource. One would expect greater\nefficiency to lead to lower consumption, but it can sometimes mean more.\n\nWhat is Jevons' Paradox?\nJevons’ Paradox is named for the British economist William Stanley Jevons\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Jevons]  who argued in 1865 that\nthe coal industry was on an unsustainable trajectory. In his book, “The Coal\nQuestion” [http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Jevons/jvnCQ.html]  Jevons,\nobserved that in the decades since the invention of Watt’s steam engine\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_steam_engine]  demand for coal outpaced\ngrowth in the population. Extrapolating this trend, Jevons concluded that demand\nfor coal would exhaust the ability to produce it, a fact with a troubling\nimplication: Long-term prosperity cannot be guaranteed by advances in efficiency\nalone.\n\nTo understand this counterintuitive finding, realize that any increase in\nefficiency necessarily makes coal necessarily cheaper. Even at a constant cost\nthe amount of work that could be obtained from a set amount of coal must\nincrease. Alternatively, increased efficiency means less coal is required to\nobtain a set amount of work.\n\n\n\nAs energy derived from coal became cheaper during the 19th century, England\nfound additional applications for it. Steam engines displaced other energy\nsources--mainly windmills, charcoal, and horses--in many existing industries\nsuch as textiles. Completely new applications such as public gas lamps in London\ndeveloped. And perhaps most importantly, cheaper coal meant more mines could be\noperated profitably, thereby making coal even cheaper:\n\nIt was asserted that mines formerly drowned out and abandoned might sometimes,\nwhen coal was very cheap, be profitably drained by his rude atmospheric engine.\nBut when Brindley went to Wolverhampton, to inspect one of these engines, he\nformed the opinion \"that, unless the consumption of coal could be reduced, the\nextended use of this steam-engine was not practicable, by reason of its\ndearness, as compared with the power of horses, wind, or air.\n\n-\"The Coal Question\" By William Stanley Jevons\n\nToday, this coal-powered feedback loop is known as a large part of the\nIndustrial Revolution.\n\nJevons saw this trend as unsustainable. Extrapolating from 83.6 million tons of\ncoal raised from mines in the UK in 1861, he estimated that by 1961 UK coal\nconsumption would stand at 2.6 billion tons per year. This is an incredible\nestimate, roughly equivalent to actual coal production for the entire world in\n1960 [http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:329110/FULLTEXT01.pdf]. Given\nthe population of the UK at the time, this estimate adjusts to 50 tons per\nperson. Put in one place, this amount of coal would create a pile over 30 meters\nwide at its base. Actual 1961 per capita coal production in the UK was 3.7 tons\nper person\n[https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/historical-coal-data-coal-production-availability-and-consumption-1853-to-2011]\n, a number very close to the same statistic in Jevons’ time.\n\n\n\nActual coal consumption in the UK peaked in the 1950s and has decreased ever\nsince\n[http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/01/uk-coal-use-to-fall-to-lowest-level-since-industrial-revolution/]\n. This is due to laws like the Clean Air Act of 1956\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_1956], banning certain uses of\ncoal, and the increased adoption of alternate energy sources, particularly\nnuclear power and natural gas from the North Sea.\n\nWhile peak coal came and went without triggering a Malthusean Catastrophe\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Malthusian_catastrophe], it is not clear that\nJevons was wrong. Without legislative intervention and the discovery of new\nsources of energy to exploit, the growth in coal consumption may have continued\nunabated. Increased efficiency may or may not have had much, if anything, to\nwith ultimately decreasing total demand for coal. Does this mean increased\nefficiency pointless then for ecological purposes?\n\nIt depends.\n\nA Modern Test of Jevons’ Paradox\nConsider gasoline consumption in the United States. In the last 40 years the\nfuel efficiency of vehicles in the US and per capita consumption demonstrate a\nnegative relationship. This has occurred without any significant legislation,\nmandating increases in fuel economy (CAFE standards\n[http://www.nhtsa.gov/fuel-economy]  remained fixed for most of this period) and\nwithout any viable alternatives to gasoline. In other words, trends in gasoline\nconsumption seem to pair real increases in efficiency with real decreases in\nconsumption.\n\n\n\nPart of the reason for this negative relationship is the fact that price has a\nstrong influence on both of these variables. When fuel is expensive drivers\nprefer more efficient cars and pocket the extra savings. When fuel is cheap,\ndrivers’ preferences shift away from fuel economy. An extreme example of this is\nthe H1, an over-engineered military-grade vehicle\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Hummer_H1], sold to civilians during the\nmid-90s fuel price nadir.\n\nWhat Americans do not change based on the price of gas is how many miles they\ndrive. In recent decades, consumers in the United States tend to drive a\nrelatively consistent amount regardless of the price of gas\n[http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=19191]. Driving is something\nAmericans do by necessity, and there are few incentives to drive any more or\nless than we already do.\n\nIf we stylize these facts, we can get a rough estimate of the degree to which\nincreases in fuel efficiency are realized as fuel savings. Assuming Americans\nalways drive a fixed number of miles in a given year and make predictable\nvehicle choices given the price of gas, analysis of the data estimates that a\n10% increase in fuel efficiency results in about a 4% decrease in per-capita\nfuel consumption. It is worth noting that while these assumptions are\nsimplistic, more sophisticated analyses\n[http://www.rff.org/RFF/Documents/RFF-DP-13-19.pdf]  concur that decreases in\nfuel consumption are always less than the corresponding increase in fuel\nefficiency.\n\nThat a 10% increase in fuel efficiency results in anything less than a 10%\ndecrease in fuel consumption tells us that Jevons' paradox still holds to a\ndegree: if gasoline or bituminous coal becomes more affordable, more of it will\nbe consumed. Whether the magnitude of this demand rebound is greater than\nsavings due to increased efficiency is a function of many factors such as\npreferences and the availability of close substitutes.\n\nIncreases in efficiency are not everything\nThe benefits of getting more out of less are self-evident, but they do not\naddress fundamental problems. Resources like coal and gasoline have large,\nunrealized social costs and their rate of consumption is disproportionately\nskewed towards the present. These market failures persist regardless of how\nefficiently a resource can be used.\n\nWhat does help is legislation designed to correct specific market failures.\nThese laws attempt to ensure that full social costs of any resource are\nexplicitly allocated to those producing and consuming resources, rather than\nbeing borne by society as a whole. A basic form of this is the UK's Clean Air\nAct of 1956, which banned certain uses of coal. This law is credited with ending\nthe recurrent air pollution events in London\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smog], and improving public health.\n\nA more sophisticated approach is Cap and Trade\n[http://www.edf.org/climate/how-cap-and-trade-works]. This scheme, efficiently\nallocates pollution \"credits\" via auction. Firms choose between purchasing\ncredits for the right to create a certain amount of pollution or investing in\ncleaner technologies. Either way, the hidden costs of resource consumption are\nmade explicit based on willingness to pay. This approach is popular with\neconomists, less so with politicians.\n\nJevons’ Paradox in a nutshell: Efficiency is good, but alone it does less than\nyou'd think.","feature_image":"/content/images/2017/11/coal-briquette-black-46801.jpeg","featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":"Jevons’ Paradox refers to the economic circumstances that cause total demand for a resource to rise in spite of advances in the efficient use of that resource.

As a cyclist and pedestrian in the area, I have a\nlot of thoughts on 2, 4, and 5. Trying to cross Monroe near the bridge in the\nmorning is a good way to die.\n\nHow it was done\nAt a high level, the process for locating the most commented-on areas is simple:\nuse comment latitude and longitude to estimate the underlying geographic\ndistribution, find the coordinates that correspond to peaks in that\ndistribution, and then keep the subset of those points with the highest\nestimated density.\n\nFor the first part, a properly-tuned kernel density estimation\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation]  of the comment\ngeographic distribution gives a smooth heat map, seen above.\n\nBandwidth selection is usually the dilemma with KDE. Here I cheat a bit by\nassuming that the underlying distribution will be strongly dictated by two\nfactors: First, how precisely users of the map placed their comments. Second,\npeople's notion of what constitutes a place (e.g., how far can I get from the\nColumbia Heights Metro before I would no longer describe myself as \"near the\nintersection\"). In my estimate, the answer to both is \"about 300 meters.\"\n\n#Determine Bandwidth and KDE output matrix side\n#1 mile = 1609.34 meters\n#1 degree lat = 54.6 miles\n#1 degree long = 69 miles)\n\nmeters <- 300\nareadim <- c()\n\nareadim['EW'] <- (max(dcmm_df$coords.x1) -\n                  min(dcmm_df$coords.x1)) * \n                  (54.6 * 1609.34)\n\nareadim['NS'] <- (max(dcmm_df$coords.x2) - \n                  min(dcmm_df$coords.x2)) *\n                  (69 * 1609.34)\n\nareadim <- floor(areadim/40)\nbandwidth <- (((meters)/1609.34)/((54.6+69)/2))\n\n#Create density estimate\ndcmm_kde <- kde2d(dcmm_df$coords.x1,\n                  dcmm_df$coords.x2,\n                  n = areadim,\n                  h = bandwidth)\n\n\nOnce we have the density estimate, we need to check second order conditions\nacross the matrix to find the local maxima. Since the output of KDE is a matrix,\nthis is as simple as differencing twice across latitude and longitude and then\ntaking those points that meet second order conditions on both latitude and\nlongitude.\n\n#Find local maxima\nmaxima <- function(x){\n  temp <- rep(FALSE, length(x))\n  temp[which(diff(sign(diff(x)))==-2)+1] <- TRUE\n  return(temp)\n}\n\nmaxima_long <- apply(dcmm_kde$z,1,maxima)\nmaxima_lat <- apply(dcmm_kde$z,2,maxima)\nmaxima_comb <- t(maxima_long) & maxima_lat\n\n\nThis will give you all local maxima, so as a final step check the estimated\ndensity at each location and choose which are the most important.\n\nThat's it: a very simple but direct means of extracting the latent structure of\na geographic distribution. Once you have the points of interest, it is possible\nto subset the original comments based on proximity, or compare against other\ngeospatial datasets.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1485381771061-e2cbd5317d9c?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&s=f87716645f6261ebc7362690060d92a8","featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":"DC's Crosstown Multimodal Transport Study solicited geocoded comments from the public about transportation options between the neighborhoods of Columbia Heights and Brookland.

Consider this account from Prescott, Arizona on March 19, 1997:\\n\\n>While doing astrophotography I observed five yellow-white lights in a \\\"V\\\" formation moving slowly from the northwest, across the sky to the northeast, then turn almost due south and continue until out of sight…During the transit, one of the trailing lights moved up and joined the three and then dropped back to the trailing position. I estimated the three light \\\"V\\\" to cover about 0.5 degrees of sky and the whole group of five lights to cover about 1 degree of sky.\\n\\nThis detailed account is one of over 80,000 documented by the [National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)](http://www.nuforc.org/). According to its website, NUFORC’s mission is: to \\\"receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events.\\\" To this end, the center relies on individuals to submit reports of UFO sightings. Many do so directly and many more are referred by the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Weather Services, NASA, and 911 emergency dispatchers, all of whom regularly direct calls they receive about UFO sightings to the NUFORC.\\n\\nThe NUFORC maintains these reports in an [online database](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxevent.html) available to the public. Examining this data can yield many interesting insights about aliens beyond their mere existence. Below are three such insights derived from reported sighting density across various partitions of time. \\n\\nIn short: certain alien preferences are curiously human. \\n\\n### Aliens Are Fans of the X-Files\\n\\nIn September 1993, the cult television show [The X-Files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files) premiered. 12 million people--about 5% of the US population at the time—watched the premier and 27 million watched during the show’s peak in 1997.  It is likely that these numbers are low, as they only count human viewership.\\n\\n![UFOSightings_PerYear](/content/images/2018/06/UFOSightings_PerYear.png)\\n\\nThe main storyline of the show follows the interactions between extra-terrestrials and FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. Aliens are a natural extension of the show’s target demographic. While Nielsen ratings for [Kepler 438b](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-438b) are not yet available, the record clearly shows a statistically significant structural-break in the number of reported sightings in 1993. Much like [Downton Abbey fans](http://www.salon.com/2012/01/27/is_it_ok_to_steal_downton_abbey/) today, aliens go to the source rather than wait to see each new season.\\n\\n### Aliens Work Hard, Party Hard \\n\\nThe 24-hour day and the 7-day week only make sense on Earth, so one would not necessarily expect UFO activity to follow a daily or a weekly pattern. Yet, this is exactly what one finds in the data: On any day of the week, UFO activity peaks between 6:00 PM and midnight. Furthermore, activity tends to be concentrated on weekends with Saturday night being the most popular and Monday the least. \\n\\n![UFOSightings_DOWandHOD](/content/images/2018/06/UFOSightings_DOWandHOD.png)\\n\\nThis schedule only makes sense if alien activity follows some human activity. Given the bias towards the evening and the weekend, one can infer that the activity that aliens are interested in occurs during human leisure time. In other words, peak-UFO activity seems to occur at the same time as peak-college-fraternity-drinking activity. Because correlation implies causation, we can finally explain why UFOs that cross light years [crash as soon as they get to New Mexico]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_UFO_incident).\\n\\n### Aliens Love America, Fireworks, Not Blowing Up Washington, DC\\n\\nThe movie [Independence Day](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/) is slander and its director, [Roland Emmerich](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000386/?ref_=tt_ov_dr), is a hack. Aliens do not intend to conquer us. They love America and they love the 4th of July.\\n\\n![UFOSightings_PerWeek](/content/images/2018/06/UFOSightings_PerWeek.png)\\n\\nMr. Emmerich’s idea of aliens is a paranoid delusion and he should be ashamed. Aliens visit earth every 4th of July to see the fireworks and eat hot dogs. The chart above shows this: In any given year, aliens are more likely to visit the earth on the 4th of July than any other day. And what else besides fireworks, hotdogs, and one terrible movie is that day known for? Also, the White House is not a pile of charred glass, suggesting aliens are mainly here for the celebration.\\n\\n### What Other Truths are Out There?\\n\\nAliens have other interests on Earth, which continued observation may help us to uncover. For example, the data also hints that aliens may come to earth to see the aurora borealis and the Leonid meteor shower or even to race experimental military aircraft. More years of observation are necessary and we sincerely hope NUFORC continues to archive these sightings.

Every December, a group of economists at PNC Bank calculates this very special price index based. Like any price index, CPI-XMAS measures the total price of a basket of goods from year to year in order to estimate changes in the overall price level of the economy. Other, less whimsical, indices look at sets of common producer inputs and consumer goods such as [cartons of eggs](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/APU0000708111?data_tool=XGtable), [gallons of gasoline](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/APU00007471A?data_tool=XGtable), or [tons of cold-rolled steel](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/WPU10170702?data_tool=XGtable). The basket for the Christmas Price Index is based entirely on the set of gifts described in \\\"The 12 Days of Christmas.\\\" \\n\\nFor Christmas 2014, the total price of this basket is [$27,673](https://www.pncchristmaspriceindex.com/pnc/price-index-by-year). Of this, $7,000 comes from the cost of seven swans-a-swimming, making it the most expense individual gift. Surprisingly, this is still not as high as the price once was, according to historic data from the index. The chart below shows CPI-XMAS with and without swans, the price level of swans alone, and the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) for reference. From it, we see that the nominal price for swans was already at $7,000 as early as 1984, when PNC first recorded the index. Given thirty years of price inflation, even at $1,000 a piece, swans are still significantly cheaper in real terms than they were when the index was started. \\n\\n![PriceIndices](/content/images/2018/06/PriceIndices.png)\\n\\nAccording to PNC, the price of swans remained constant at $1,000 a bird from 1984 to 1994. In 1995, that price crashed to $500 and remained depressed for several years before slowly recovering. [PNC notes that this crash occurred](https://www.pncchristmaspriceindex.com/pdf/2014-Price-Index.pdf) in educational and press materials, but does not explain why it occurred. Instead, PNC treats this anomaly with a separate “core” CPI-XMAS index, which excludes price-volatile swans. Without swans, CPI-XMAS has a steady upward trend similar to official CPI, as one would expect.\\n\\n### Why Swans?\\n\\nThere are two broad explanations for why the price of swans would crash: a demand shock or a supply shock. In the former, swans become less popular for some reason, and the amount consumers are willing to spend on swans drops. In the latter, new swan suppliers enter the market, existing suppliers expand capacity, or some of both occurs. While both of these would cause a price fall, their impact on quantity is quite different. All else held equal, a negative demand shock will decrease the market’s equilibrium quantity and a positive supply shock will increase it.\\n\\nAs luck would have it, mute swans, the very swans cited in the Christmas Price Index, are an invasive species, and therefore subject to population monitoring. In 1985, the [Atlantic Flyway Council](http://www.flyways.us/) began conducting mute swan population surveys every three to four years along the east coast of the United States. The [Mute Swan Mid-Summer Survey (MSMSS)](http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/document/1374270/2011_mute_swan_survey_results_pdf) does not attempt to count the whole population, but rather, estimates population growth by counting all swans in a small area. Below are the results of the MSMSS for Pennsylvania plotted against the price of swans as reported in CPI-XMAS for corresponding years:  \\n\\n![SwanMarket](/content/images/2018/06/SwanMarket.png)\\n\\nThe relationship is significant and negative. In other words, as the price of swans fell, the quantity of swans provided increased. This strongly suggests that a supply shock of some kind caused the 1995 price crash. David Miller, an avian expert at the National Aviary, shared his interpretation:\\n\\n>In 1995, swan breeders, for some reason unknown to me, increased in number. A drop in the sale value to $500 could be due to a change in demand or an influx of breeders in a competitive market dropping the price for a short period of time. The new breeders couldn’t sustain that cost for long, so they faded away, leaving the long-term breeders to sustain the market. That’s the only explanation I can see for that time period.\\n\\n### Another explanation: It's New York's fault\\n\\nAnother possible explanation for the supply shock is New York's 1993 [mute swan management plan](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/nyregion/a-winged-symbol-of-love-that-new-york-state-wants-banished.html?_r=0). Under the plan, birds were removed from state-owned wildlife areas and their eggs were oiled to prevent hatching. The plan strictly forbade killing mute swans, possibly due to the [popularity the birds enjoy](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/opinion/speaking-up-for-the-mute-swan.html).\\n\\nNew York achieved some success with this plan. Between 1993 and 1996, the MSMSS shows that the mute swan population in New York declined by 400 observed birds. Since the birds were not killed, it is possible they were exported to Pennsylvania and other nearby states. In other words, New York might have crushed the ornamental swan market by driving birds across the state line. New York's population decrease is more than enough to account for population increase in Pennsylvania, which is hard to explain through normal growth alone.\\n \\nIn recent years, the effects of the shock have reversed. This may be due to breeders exiting the market, but probably has more to do with a new [multi-state initiative]( https://www.michigan.gov/documents/dnr/AFC_mute_swan_plan1_364878_7.pdf) launched in 2003 to decrease the east coast mute swan population as a whole. While this will have an adverse effect on the year-over-year change in the Christmas Price Index and commensurate merriment and good tidings, it is anticipated to benefit native waterfowl and aquatic fauna.\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<p><em>This piece was originally published on on the blog, Questionable Economics.

The Mute Swan Mid-Summer Survey (MSMSS)\n[http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/document/1374270/2011_mute_swan_survey_results_pdf] \n does not attempt to count the whole population, but rather, estimates\npopulation growth by counting all swans in a small area. Below are the results\nof the MSMSS for Pennsylvania plotted against the price of swans as reported in\nCPI-XMAS for corresponding years:\n\n\n\nThe relationship is significant and negative. In other words, as the price of\nswans fell, the quantity of swans provided increased. This strongly suggests\nthat a supply shock of some kind caused the 1995 price crash. David Miller, an\navian expert at the National Aviary, shared his interpretation:\n\nIn 1995, swan breeders, for some reason unknown to me, increased in number. A\ndrop in the sale value to $500 could be due to a change in demand or an influx\nof breeders in a competitive market dropping the price for a short period of\ntime. The new breeders couldn’t sustain that cost for long, so they faded away,\nleaving the long-term breeders to sustain the market. That’s the only\nexplanation I can see for that time period.\n\nAnother explanation: It's New York's fault\nAnother possible explanation for the supply shock is New York's 1993 mute swan\nmanagement plan\n[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/nyregion/a-winged-symbol-of-love-that-new-york-state-wants-banished.html?_r=0]\n. Under the plan, birds were removed from state-owned wildlife areas and their\neggs were oiled to prevent hatching. The plan strictly forbade killing mute\nswans, possibly due to the popularity the birds enjoy\n[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/opinion/speaking-up-for-the-mute-swan.html].\n\nNew York achieved some success with this plan. Between 1993 and 1996, the MSMSS\nshows that the mute swan population in New York declined by 400 observed birds.\nSince the birds were not killed, it is possible they were exported to\nPennsylvania and other nearby states. In other words, New York might have\ncrushed the ornamental swan market by driving birds across the state line. New\nYork's population decrease is more than enough to account for population\nincrease in Pennsylvania, which is hard to explain through normal growth alone.\n\nIn recent years, the effects of the shock have reversed. This may be due to\nbreeders exiting the market, but probably has more to do with a new multi-state\ninitiative\n[https://www.michigan.gov/documents/dnr/AFC_mute_swan_plan1_364878_7.pdf] \nlaunched in 2003 to decrease the east coast mute swan population as a whole.\nWhile this will have an adverse effect on the year-over-year change in the\nChristmas Price Index and commensurate merriment and good tidings, it is\nanticipated to benefit native waterfowl and aquatic fauna.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487972467151-efb3a8a465f2?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&s=024cae36a666f2235a30bfdfdaa0ef21","featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":"You probably missed it: according to a notable economic indicator, a major sector of the U.S. economy crashed in 1995 and has only recently recovered to pre-crisis levels.

The use of data within journalism can tell stories in interesting ways, and adds a type of credibility that anecdote alone cannot. This guide explains the basics and best practices of creating effective visualizations for posts on GreaterGreaterWashington.\\n\\n### When to Create a Visualization\\n\\nVisualizations should support and enhance the articles they’re in. For example, Section 1 of GGW’s post template contains the “Main thing” that the post will convey. If a visualization will be used as the post’s main image, the first visualization should illustrate and support this main thing.\\n\\nData visualizations don’t always have to be created from scratch. If a suitable visualization already exists from another source, that visual should be used as-is with attribution (a link to the original). If the visual is unsuitable (for example, if it is unreadable at the required width) it should be recreated with attribution to the original visual’s author.\\n\\n### Step 1: Determine the right visualizations for your article\\n\\nThe subject of the article should drive the visualization, not the other way around. Authors should consider where examining available data could improve or substantiate the points made in the article. Data should add to the subject without disrupting the logical flow of the article. Authors should avoid visuals and data that is irrelevant or likely to confuse.\\n\\nIn this step, quickly sketching the final visualization is a good exercise to test if the the data makes sense in context, and focus the goal of subsequent steps. This is particularly important for more complex visualizations.\\n\\nPicking the right visual for the article is an extensive topic. A huge variety of visuals and combinations of visuals exist which may or may not be appropriate for a given situation.  In general, understanding the proper application of a few simple visuals is adequate for most purposes.\\n\\n* Bar charts compare aggregate values across simple groupings (e.g., 2016 average rents by neighborhood)\\n* Line charts show how aggregate values have changed over time with a line for each grouping of interest. (e.g., Average rents from 2000 to 2016 by neighborhood)\\n* Scatter plots illustrate how two numeric variables interact with each other. (e.g., Average rents compared to median income in 2016 by neighborhood)\\n* Maps can use a variety of graphic elements such as shaded regions (“Choropleth maps”) or points (“Point maps”)\\n\\nMost data can be conveyed using one or more of these four simple visuals. More advanced visuals are welcome, but are usually not strictly necessary.\\n\\nFinally, it is worth noting that pie charts are never appropriate. Consider instead: point graphs or Pareto charts.\\n\\nFor more on picking the right visual, see… by...\\n\\n### Step 2: Finding the right data\\n\\nData on many aspects of the greater DC area are available at several online repositories. This list is a good place to start:\\n\\n* http://data.codefordc.org/\\n* http://opendata.dc.gov/\\n* http://factfinder.census.gov/\\n* http://data.octo.dc.gov/\\n\\nData can also be obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests directly to the agency of interests. FOIA requests can be  time consuming and often involve repeated follow-ups. For more, see this guide on FOIA requests from the National Security Archive.\\n\\nIf data is unavailable, the author should reconsider step 1, how to tell the story with data.\\n\\nFor more on obtaining good data, see… by...\\n\\n### Step 3: Transforming data\\n\\nRaw data is not usually right for the specific visualization the author intends. The process of converting data into the desired form is a non standard task that can be either easy, hard, or anything in between. \\n\\nSpreadsheet applications such as Google sheets are most commonly used for data transformation. More advanced tools include R, Python, SQL or QGIS for geospatial applications.  \\n\\nRegardless of the tool, the process of data transformation is the same. At a minimum, the author should ensure that the data meets the following criteria:\\n\\n* Cleaned (Fix obvious errors in the data. i.e., spelling errors)\\n* Filtered (Subset a city-wide database to a specific neighborhood)\\n* Aggregated (Turn a dataset with individual 911 calls into a dataset with total calls per hour)\\n* Formatted (Alter variables so they match the desired format  “1/1/2017” to “January 1, 2017”)\\n\\nTransforming data tends to be the most time consuming in the process. It is also the point where mistakes are most likely to occur. [[assistance?]]\\n\\nFor more on transforming data, see… by...\\n\\n### Step 4: Visualizing the Data\\n\\nUsing the sketch from Step 1 and data from Step 3, the author should use an appropriate tool to create the data visualization. \\n\\nGreater Greater Washington does not have rigid style standards for visualizations. Authors should instead adhere to the following set of guidelines and best-practices: \\n\\n* The visual should contain a title and may contain a subtitle to explain the purpose of the visual.\\n* The visual should contain some attribution to the data source.\\n* The visual’s width should be exactly 1200 pixels.\\n* The font should be large enough to be legible on mobile devices. \\n* No more than five colors should be used.\\n* Color palettes should be viewable for individuals with red-green colorblindness  (see here for examples)\\n* No color gradients\\n* Sans Serif fonts, only. [Open Sans Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans+Condensed) is a good option.\\n* Units should always be specified clearly ($1.3M/year vs. 1,300,000)\\n* Maps of Washington, DC should use the Maryland State Plane Projection (EPSG: 26985) to minimize distortion.\\n\\nBasic data visualization tools are readily available within Google sheets (see guide). More advanced tools are available in Python ([matlibplot](http://matplotlib.org/)), R ([ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/)), [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/), [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/), and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).\\n\\nCertain visualizations can also be created using GreaterGreaterWashington’s own data visualization tool (a fork of [RAW](http://raw.densitydesign.org/) by DensityDesign). The tool provides authors with the ability to create specific visualizations pre-formatted to adhere to the above best practices and Greater Greater Washington’s website design.\\n\\nWhen submitting the final visual the author should submit the visual as both a vector graphic (SVG) and as a raster graphic (PNG, GIF, JPEG). \\n\\n### Step 5: Creating a repository\\n\\nSavvy readers will rightly expect to view source data and any intervening steps used to create a visualization. As a best-practice, authors are urged to provide a link at the end of their article to the data and other intermediate products such as code. \\n\\nGithub is the gold standard, for these repositories. For example, [here is 538’s extensive set of repositories](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data). For many advanced visuals, such as those built in R, Python, or D3.js, Github is strongly encouraged. \\n\\nFor simpler visuals, a public link to Google sheets is a convenient alternative. An embedded Tableau workbook is also an attractive option as it provides the underlying data by default.\\n\\nFor an example of well-documented repositories, see… by...\\n\\n### Limitations of Data Visualization\\n\\nIt is possible for data to mislead, so care must be taken to ensure that the story told by the visual is accurate. The author should verify the data by consulting subject matter experts or even direct confirmation of data points when appropriate. \\n\\nVisualizations also tend to dehumanize subject matter. Data visualizations excel at simplifying stories at a grand scale, but this abstraction comes at a cost: the subject matter is less relatable at an individual level. This detachment can be useful as when human error introduces bias (the anti-vaccination movement, for example). In other cases, though, this detachment can weaken a story or even be outright offensive. A best practice is to pair visualization with representative anecdotes. In this way, the reader can understand both macro trends and how they play out at an individual level.\\n\\n### Additional Resources \\n* [Ezra Klein on visualization attribution](http://www.vox.com/2015/4/13/8405999/how-vox-aggregates)\\n* [Nate Silver’s manifesto](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/)\\n* [Data journalism handbook (Beta)](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/)\\n\\n\\n----\\n### Another Version\\nAssumptions: Little or no data, no idea what the answer to the key questions are, and integration into some form of storytelling medium(article, listicle, video). The challenge here is the catch-22: how do you tell the story without knowing what the data says vs how do you know what questions to ask the data without knowing what story you want to tell. The key is starting small and iterating. Always start and end with the story.\\n\\nNote: what is the proper role of anecdote/example?\\n\\nPreparation\\n\\nChoose your topic\\nIdentify key questions for the data(hypothesis)\\nResearch topic and obtain data (can be challenging if data is not widely available.

They're busy people like you, they just need a reminder every now and then.\\n\\n(???)\\nReporting correlation is safe, but be careful about inferring causality.

The use of data within\njournalism can tell stories in interesting ways, and adds a type of credibility\nthat anecdote alone cannot. This guide explains the basics and best practices of\ncreating effective visualizations for posts on GreaterGreaterWashington.\n\nWhen to Create a Visualization\nVisualizations should support and enhance the articles they’re in. For example,\nSection 1 of GGW’s post template contains the “Main thing” that the post will\nconvey. If a visualization will be used as the post’s main image, the first\nvisualization should illustrate and support this main thing.\n\nData visualizations don’t always have to be created from scratch. If a suitable\nvisualization already exists from another source, that visual should be used\nas-is with attribution (a link to the original). If the visual is unsuitable\n(for example, if it is unreadable at the required width) it should be recreated\nwith attribution to the original visual’s author.\n\nStep 1: Determine the right visualizations for your article\nThe subject of the article should drive the visualization, not the other way\naround. Authors should consider where examining available data could improve or\nsubstantiate the points made in the article. Data should add to the subject\nwithout disrupting the logical flow of the article. Authors should avoid visuals\nand data that is irrelevant or likely to confuse.\n\nIn this step, quickly sketching the final visualization is a good exercise to\ntest if the the data makes sense in context, and focus the goal of subsequent\nsteps. This is particularly important for more complex visualizations.\n\nPicking the right visual for the article is an extensive topic. A huge variety\nof visuals and combinations of visuals exist which may or may not be appropriate\nfor a given situation. In general, understanding the proper application of a few\nsimple visuals is adequate for most purposes.\n\n * Bar charts compare aggregate values across simple groupings (e.g., 2016\n   average rents by neighborhood)\n * Line charts show how aggregate values have changed over time with a line for\n   each grouping of interest. (e.g., Average rents from 2000 to 2016 by\n   neighborhood)\n * Scatter plots illustrate how two numeric variables interact with each other.\n   (e.g., Average rents compared to median income in 2016 by neighborhood)\n * Maps can use a variety of graphic elements such as shaded regions\n   (“Choropleth maps”) or points (“Point maps”)\n\nMost data can be conveyed using one or more of these four simple visuals. More\nadvanced visuals are welcome, but are usually not strictly necessary.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that pie charts are never appropriate. Consider\ninstead: point graphs or Pareto charts.\n\nFor more on picking the right visual, see… by...\n\nStep 2: Finding the right data\nData on many aspects of the greater DC area are available at several online\nrepositories. This list is a good place to start:\n\n * http://data.codefordc.org/\n * http://opendata.dc.gov/\n * http://factfinder.census.gov/\n * http://data.octo.dc.gov/\n\nData can also be obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests directly\nto the agency of interests. FOIA requests can be time consuming and often\ninvolve repeated follow-ups. For more, see this guide on FOIA requests from the\nNational Security Archive.\n\nIf data is unavailable, the author should reconsider step 1, how to tell the\nstory with data.\n\nFor more on obtaining good data, see… by...\n\nStep 3: Transforming data\nRaw data is not usually right for the specific visualization the author intends.\nThe process of converting data into the desired form is a non standard task that\ncan be either easy, hard, or anything in between.\n\nSpreadsheet applications such as Google sheets are most commonly used for data\ntransformation. More advanced tools include R, Python, SQL or QGIS for\ngeospatial applications.\n\nRegardless of the tool, the process of data transformation is the same. At a\nminimum, the author should ensure that the data meets the following criteria:\n\n * Cleaned (Fix obvious errors in the data. i.e., spelling errors)\n * Filtered (Subset a city-wide database to a specific neighborhood)\n * Aggregated (Turn a dataset with individual 911 calls into a dataset with\n   total calls per hour)\n * Formatted (Alter variables so they match the desired format “1/1/2017” to\n   “January 1, 2017”)\n\nTransforming data tends to be the most time consuming in the process. It is also\nthe point where mistakes are most likely to occur. [[assistance?]]\n\nFor more on transforming data, see… by...\n\nStep 4: Visualizing the Data\nUsing the sketch from Step 1 and data from Step 3, the author should use an\nappropriate tool to create the data visualization.\n\nGreater Greater Washington does not have rigid style standards for\nvisualizations. Authors should instead adhere to the following set of guidelines\nand best-practices:\n\n * The visual should contain a title and may contain a subtitle to explain the\n   purpose of the visual.\n * The visual should contain some attribution to the data source.\n * The visual’s width should be exactly 1200 pixels.\n * The font should be large enough to be legible on mobile devices.\n * No more than five colors should be used.\n * Color palettes should be viewable for individuals with red-green\n   colorblindness (see here for examples)\n * No color gradients\n * Sans Serif fonts, only. Open Sans Condensed\n   [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans+Condensed]  is a good option.\n * Units should always be specified clearly ($1.3M/year vs. 1,300,000)\n * Maps of Washington, DC should use the Maryland State Plane Projection (EPSG:\n   26985) to minimize distortion.\n\nBasic data visualization tools are readily available within Google sheets (see\nguide).

Cars are complex things, so there is a high degree of information asymmetry when buying one: the buyer usually has no way of knowing the quality and therefore the real value of the vehicle being sold. The seller does know, but has an incentive to conceal this information or even blatantly misrepresent it. A savvy buyer knows the seller's incentives and thus always suspects that there is a chance any given car could end up being a lemon.\\n\\nConsider this scenario: A, a potential car buyer, will choose between one of two cars sold by B and C. A knows that one car, the plum,  is worth $15,000 and the other, the lemon, is  worth $5,000, but cannot determine what any specific car is worth. Accounting for the risk of picking the lemon, A offers both B and C $10,000, the average value for their vehicles. This gives A an equal chance of either gaining or losing $5,000 in the transaction. A is risk neutral, so this is an acceptable arrangement. \\n\\nB takes this deal: He owns the lemon and A’s offer is higher than if the true quality of the car was known. C refuses A’s offer for the opposite reason. In repeated iterations of this game, C may not even show up because he knows that he will not be offered a good price. The asymmetry of information between A, B, and C means that only lemons are sold in this stylized used car market.\\n\\nThe real world is more complicated. Used car quality varies continuously and across many dimensions. dividing cars into lemons and non-lemons is an imprecise science. Furthermore, unlike A, agents in real used car markets are not risk neutral. Cars are large investments and buyers tend to treat their purchase with considerable care. Like A, actual buyers reduce their offers based on lack of knowledge and perceived risk. \\n\\n### How does this work in the illicit materials market?\\n\\nContinuous quality and buyer risk aversion can be [modeled](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~jdh1/micro%202/lectures/me34.htm) with a variation on the simple supply and demand model. In the model, the effects of asymmetric information are represented by a backward bending of the demand curve.\\n\\n![Adverse_selection](/content/images/2017/11/Adverse_selection.png)\\n\\nThis chart has four demand curves and four possible market equilibria representing four states of information asymmetry. D<sub>0</sub> is a normal demand curve, which assumes both buyer and seller have perfect (or at least symmetric) information. Under these assumptions, the market reaches equilibrium at point A. D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> represent situations in which information asymmetry exists, but still allows the market to clear at the less efficient points, C, B, and D. Interestingly, D<sub>1</sub> has two stable equilibrium points suggesting that shocks in the quality of goods available on the market can cause permanent changes in equilibrium price and quantity. D<sub>3</sub> represents the point at which the effect of the information asymmetry is severe enough to prevent all transactions.\\n \\nThe fact that some people believe that red mercury exists and have gone to [bizarre lengths](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-04-15/red-mercury-hoax-sparks-sewing-machine-frenzy/1650990) to obtain it, is one example of the information asymetry in the blackmarket for illicit nuclear materials. Another is the sale of [fake uranium](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/08/bangladesh-uranium-sale-2014824144850414854.html) and [fabricated nuclear secrets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Merlin). All these are signs that this market does not clear efficiently. This is good, as the riskier potential buyers perceive the market, the less efficient it becomes. counting illegal transactions that do not occur is a difficult task, but this information asymmetry has likely prevented some transactions that would have put dangerous items into the hands of dangerous people.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<p>In February 2010, my platoon aided another group of U.S. soldiers and Iraqi Federal Police who had captured a smuggler's cache near Baghdad during a raid.

It\nwas only after we had made the move that our Iraqi counterparts informed us us\nthat they believed the material was for building nuclear weapons. They said this\nwith complete sincerity.\n\nPersonally, I wished they had told me this before I had spent two hours\ntravelling with it sitting next to me in a Humvee.\n\nLater with the help of wikipedia, I discovered that red mercury\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_mercury]  cannot be used for nuclear weapons\nor any other purpose. In fact, it does not seem to actually exist at all. By\nreputation, it is a powerful and much sought after substance that has uses in\nthe production of fissionable materials or in the skin of stealth aircraft, and\nan indeterminate list of other applications. From my research, the exact\nproperties of red mercury seem to vary depending on the needs of the one buying\nit and the imagination of the one selling it. It sounds ridiculous, but some\npeople seem convinced [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5176382.stm]  it\nexists.\n\nHow can this fictitious substance save the world? By introducing information\nasymmetry into a dangerous market.\n\nWhat you don't know can help me\nEconomist George Akerlof [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Akerlof]  explains\nhow the phemoninon of market failure to information asymmetry works in the used\ncar market\n[http://www.iei.liu.se/nek/730g83/artiklar/1.328833/AkerlofMarketforLemons.pdf].\nCars are complex things, so there is a high degree of information asymmetry when\nbuying one: the buyer usually has no way of knowing the quality and therefore\nthe real value of the vehicle being sold. The seller does know, but has an\nincentive to conceal this information or even blatantly misrepresent it. A savvy\nbuyer knows the seller's incentives and thus always suspects that there is a\nchance any given car could end up being a lemon.\n\nConsider this scenario: A, a potential car buyer, will choose between one of two\ncars sold by B and C. A knows that one car, the plum, is worth $15,000 and the\nother, the lemon, is worth $5,000, but cannot determine what any specific car is\nworth. Accounting for the risk of picking the lemon, A offers both B and C\n$10,000, the average value for their vehicles. This gives A an equal chance of\neither gaining or losing $5,000 in the transaction. A is risk neutral, so this\nis an acceptable arrangement.\n\nB takes this deal: He owns the lemon and A’s offer is higher than if the true\nquality of the car was known. C refuses A’s offer for the opposite reason. In\nrepeated iterations of this game, C may not even show up because he knows that\nhe will not be offered a good price. The asymmetry of information between A, B,\nand C means that only lemons are sold in this stylized used car market.\n\nThe real world is more complicated. Used car quality varies continuously and\nacross many dimensions. dividing cars into lemons and non-lemons is an imprecise\nscience. Furthermore, unlike A, agents in real used car markets are not risk\nneutral. Cars are large investments and buyers tend to treat their purchase with\nconsiderable care. Like A, actual buyers reduce their offers based on lack of\nknowledge and perceived risk.\n\nHow does this work in the illicit materials market?\nContinuous quality and buyer risk aversion can be modeled\n[http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~jdh1/micro%202/lectures/me34.htm]  with a\nvariation on the simple supply and demand model. In the model, the effects of\nasymmetric information are represented by a backward bending of the demand\ncurve.\n\n\n\nThis chart has four demand curves and four possible market equilibria\nrepresenting four states of information asymmetry. D0  is a normal demand curve,\nwhich assumes both buyer and seller have perfect (or at least symmetric)\ninformation. Under these assumptions, the market reaches equilibrium at point A.\nD1  and D2  represent situations in which information asymmetry exists, but\nstill allows the market to clear at the less efficient points, C, B, and D.\nInterestingly, D1  has two stable equilibrium points suggesting that shocks in\nthe quality of goods available on the market can cause permanent changes in\nequilibrium price and quantity. D3  represents the point at which the effect of\nthe information asymmetry is severe enough to prevent all transactions.\n\nThe fact that some people believe that red mercury exists and have gone to \nbizarre lengths\n[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-04-15/red-mercury-hoax-sparks-sewing-machine-frenzy/1650990] \n to obtain it, is one example of the information asymetry in the blackmarket for\nillicit nuclear materials. Another is the sale of fake uranium\n[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/08/bangladesh-uranium-sale-2014824144850414854.html] \n and fabricated nuclear secrets [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Merlin].\nAll these are signs that this market does not clear efficiently. This is good,\nas the riskier potential buyers perceive the market, the less efficient it\nbecomes. counting illegal transactions that do not occur is a difficult task,\nbut this information asymmetry has likely prevented some transactions that would\nhave put dangerous items into the hands of dangerous people.","feature_image":"/content/images/2017/11/boom.jpeg","featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":"By some accounts, red mercury is a powerful material used for building nuclear weapons, stealth bombers, and old sewing machines.
